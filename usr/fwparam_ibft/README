The files in this directory are used by
iscsi programs in "usr" to access and parse
the iBFT data.

This code uses bison/lex to parse the data,
but at some point it was decided to check in
the output files from bison and flex, so that
the average source-code user would not have
to run those tools to compile the code.

Now it is likely that most folks can get those
tools, but the system of having static
parsing and lexical analysis has worked for
so long (and isn't broken), it would be a
shame to change and break it. So the static
files remain, for now. If you actually wish
to rerun either of these tools, the Makefile
is set up so that you have to first remove the
generated files (prom_lex.c for lex, prom_parse.tab.c,
and prom_parse.tab.h for bison).

Note: if you wish to use these object files,
they have two external requirements: they
need the compatability routines in sysdeps.o,
and they need the file iscsi_net_util.o.
